## Why do I (you) need a portfolio?

There has always been a debate whether or not a developer should have his/her own portfolio. Even if you decide to have one why not leverage the reach of popular platforms like Behance or Dribble for designers or Github for develoeprs? IMO, you should absolutely have a Dribble or Github portfolio to showcase your work but there's a limit to it. As a designer or front end developer you may want to showcase your in such a way that it stands out from others or in other words you may want to show your creativity while presenting your work, elaborating the problems you solved by that product while making sure it solves the original intent of having a portfolio at first place(getting a job or freelance projects).

Additionally, blogging about work, ideas or your life in general is also essential if you want to solidify your understanding of a concept, improving your writting, connecting with like minded people and helping them out with something you know. Writting is difficult, at least for me and writting in a way that keeps your visitor hooked is a tough task but certainly benefitial in marking your web presence.

And, there is no better place to showcase your works and writting at a same place, in a presentable and customised manner. With the invent of static site generators and JAMStack in general, it is really simple to have your own portfolio out there in the wild. To keep it updated and full of useful content is, well, the reason why budding developers like me dump the half-finished portfolio(s) in the middle.
