I am more into video tutorails when it comes to learning something outside the scope of my academics. Partly because I find it tedious to read through materials and learning at the same time so that I can apply this new knowledge when I stumble upon a similar problem just to realise that "crap! I think I know it but where do I start again?". While there are some great books, blogs, documentations to learn anything under the sky video tutorails seem more approachable to me because I can practice and get instant feeback while watching it. However there are some great bloggers out there who swiftly bridge this gap. In this article I will introduce you to some of my (all-time) favorite blogs, you don't want to miss out on if you are JavaScript developer.
