This is my first hosted portfolio. After months of exploring reasons, building good projects and trying out tools to build it I have finally decided to settle with Next.js/React and MDX. It has transformed over the last few months - from a static HTML site, to Gatsby and finally this. My personal slice of the internet provides a platform for my technical writings, to share my work experience, to showcase my latest design/development work and to contact me for freelance projects and advices.
